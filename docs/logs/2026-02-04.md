## 20:35

Implemented simpledoc log command with auto timezone/date and thresholded sections; writing this entry to document the work.

Added multiline support to simpledoc log.

- CLI now accepts --stdin and preserves newline content with proper indentation.
- Spec updated to mention CLI indentation for multiline input.

Auto-read stdin for simpledoc log when piped, matching Unix utility expectations.

- Kept --stdin for explicit use.

Updated SimpleLog to preserve raw input and insert a blank line before new entries, without indentation changes.

## 21:08

Test run after removing auto timestamps and keeping blank-line separation.

Multiline test entry.

- line two
- line three

## 21:14

Summarized today’s SimpleLog changes and tests.

- Updated spec to drop auto timestamps, require frontmatter, and use threshold-based session sections.
- Adjusted CLI to preserve raw input, insert blank lines, and update frontmatter timestamps.
- Logged multiline and stdin behaviors; updated README and skill docs.

Updated SimpleDoc skill to instruct agents to log noteworthy actions and discoveries.

Updated SimpleDoc skill to log ongoing progress, not just significant events.

Expanded SimpleDoc skill logging guidance to cover anything worth noting (significant events and ongoing progress).

Added config spec for simpledoc.json and .simpledoc.local.json with precedence and schema details.

- Documented usage in README, SimpleLog spec, and SimpleDoc skill.
- Added .simpledoc.local.json to .gitignore.

Expanded config spec with docs.root, frontmatter.defaults, check.ignore, and simplelog.timezone.

## 21:44

Implemented config loading (simpledoc.json + .simpledoc.local.json) with precedence and defaults.

- Wired docs.root, frontmatter.defaults, check.ignore, and simplelog.\* into CLI + migrator logic.
- Added config tests plus docsRoot/ignore/frontmatter default coverage.
- Ran npm test (all passing).

## 21:59

Refactored config validation and shared helpers for docs root, ignore globs, and frontmatter formatting.

- Normalized docs root + simplelog root handling and stricter config type checks.
- Log frontmatter now uses ordered fields via shared builder.
- Added shared frontmatter/ignore/path helpers; tests: npm test.

## 22:06

Allowed date-only filenames for SimpleDoc (e.g., SimpleLog daily files) and updated tooling.

- Updated SimpleDoc spec + README to allow date-only docs.
- Naming normalization now keeps date-only filenames; added plan test.
- Added simpledoc check to pre-commit hook.
- Tests: npm test.

Refactored pre-commit to run a single npm script, centralized frontmatter field order, and moved frontmatter parsing into a shared helper.

- Added npm script precommit and updated .husky/pre-commit.
- Exported frontmatter order constants + parse helper in src/frontmatter.ts; log/migrator now reuse.
- Tests: npm test.

Updated CLI instruction strings to use npx with the package name for migrate guidance.

- check/install outputs now say `npx -y @simpledoc/simpledoc migrate`.
- migrate/install intro labels updated to show the npx command.
- Config spec references updated.
- Tests: npm test.

Added tests for config validation errors, frontmatter helpers, and SimpleLog threshold section behavior.

- New config error tests for invalid types.
- New frontmatter tests for ordered output + parsing.
- New log test with mocked time to verify threshold-based sections.
- Tests: npm test.

## 22:27

Updated SimpleLog section thresholding to use a frontmatter `last_section` timestamp and documented it in the spec.

- CLI now compares threshold against last_section (or last section heading if missing).
- Frontmatter order includes last_section; updated log test to assert it.
- Spec now documents last_section as optional frontmatter.
- Tests: npm test.

Rebuilt CLI output so logs now write `last_section` to frontmatter.
