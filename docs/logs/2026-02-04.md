## 20:35

Implemented simpledoc log command with auto timezone/date and thresholded sections; writing this entry to document the work.

Added multiline support to simpledoc log.

- CLI now accepts --stdin and preserves newline content with proper indentation.
- Spec updated to mention CLI indentation for multiline input.

Auto-read stdin for simpledoc log when piped, matching Unix utility expectations.

- Kept --stdin for explicit use.

Updated SimpleLog to preserve raw input and insert a blank line before new entries, without indentation changes.

## 21:08

Test run after removing auto timestamps and keeping blank-line separation.

Multiline test entry.

## 21:14

Summarized today’s SimpleLog changes and tests.

- Updated spec to drop auto timestamps, require frontmatter, and use threshold-based session sections.
- Adjusted CLI to preserve raw input, insert blank lines, and update frontmatter timestamps.
- Logged multiline and stdin behaviors; updated README and skill docs.

Updated SimpleDoc skill to instruct agents to log noteworthy actions and discoveries.
