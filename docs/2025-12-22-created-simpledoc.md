I have been using this convention, inspired by Jekyll, in all my projects for some time now. I am saddened to see posts online complaining about AI agents littering the repository root with capitalized files, since this is a problem I have completely solved a while ago.

At the beginning, I did not know how to communicate the solution easily while fitting it into a tweet. "The convention is common sense, someone must have written it down already" I have thought to myself. But I searched and couldn't find a definition like the one I created here. They were too complicated or opinionated to be universally accepted.

So I created this. I hope it helps you create order out of chaos in your `docs/` folder.

This post is both a blog post intended to mark this event, and an example for SimpleDoc itself, together with the bundled skill at [skills/simpledoc/SKILL.md](../skills/simpledoc/SKILL.md).
