Implemented simpledoc log command with auto timezone/date and thresholded sections; writing this entry to document the work.

Added multiline support to simpledoc log.

- CLI now accepts --stdin and preserves newline content with proper indentation.
- Spec updated to mention CLI indentation for multiline input.

Auto-read stdin for simpledoc log when piped, matching Unix utility expectations.

- Kept --stdin for explicit use.

Updated SimpleLog to preserve raw input and insert a blank line before new entries, without indentation changes.
